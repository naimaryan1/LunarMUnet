# LunarMUnet
Multiclass Artificial Lunar Surface Segmentation Using U-Net in PyTorch

Earth’s Moon remains a frontier for exploration and a stepping stone for planetary exploration. Due to lack of atmosphere, distance from Earth’s resources, and infrastructure autonomous operations are a viable solution to build lunar infrastructure. I propose to implement the U-Net-only image segmentation lunar landscape segmentation for rock detection. The goal is to determine if U-Net is suitable based on performance metrics such as (Dice an/or IoU).
