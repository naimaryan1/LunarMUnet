Multiclass Artificial Lunar Surface Segmentation Using U-Net in PyTorch

Earth’s Moon remains a frontier for exploration and a stepping stone for planetary exploration. Due to lack of atmosphere, distance from Earth’s resources, and infrastructure autonomous operations are a viable solution to build lunar infrastructure. I propose to implement the U-Net-only image segmentation lunar landscape segmentation for rock detection. The goal is to determine if U-Net is suitable based on performance metrics such as (Dice an/or IoU). 

1) Clone the repo & open "Final unet_lunar_rocks.ipynb"  Google Collab Notebook.

   i) You will need a Google Gmail & Collab account.
   ii) You will need a Kaggle account as described in "Final unet_lunar_rocks.ipynb" to get the   
   training data. 

   OR

   You can copy the code to your local drive.

3) Code has been tested using Python 3.11 & and it is better you use a virtual environment.
4) Either by executing the "Final unet_lunar_rocks.ipynb" "SECTION 1" or copy the code & locally run:
  
pip install -r  requirements.txt

4) Follow directions in "Multiclass Image Segmentation using U-Net on Lunar Landscape Data Using Pytorch.pdf"

Here is what the training data looks like:
